# Body Mass Index calculator, using various javascript frameworks

## Why

Simply to compare the code between frameworks/tools!

The files that contain the interesting code:
- [Javascript + React](https://github.com/magopian/bmi-calculator-polyglot/blob/master/react/src/App.js)
- [ClojureScript + Reagent](https://github.com/magopian/bmi-calculator-polyglot/blob/master/reagent/src/cljs/bmi_reagent/app.cljs)
- [Javascript + CycleJS](https://github.com/magopian/bmi-calculator-polyglot/blob/master/cyclejs/scripts.es6/index.js)
- [Elm](https://github.com/magopian/bmi-calculator-polyglot/blob/master/elm/BMI.elm)


## What

I simply took the code for the body mass index calculator in the
[Reagent tutorial](https://reagent-project.github.io/index.html), and tried to
port it to different other frameworks and tools. Disclaimer: I'm a noob
Javascript and clojurescript dev, and only went through the tutorial of the
frameworks used here. If you see something weird, or which could be improved,
please let me know!

Check the framework folders' README.md to see how to use them.
